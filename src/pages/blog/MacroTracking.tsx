          If you've been struggling to see results despite eating "clean" or counting calories, you're not alone. The missing piece of the puzzle might be right in front of you: understanding and tracking your macronutrients.

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Here's the truth: counting calories alone is like trying to win a chess game by only moving pawns. You might make some progress, but you're missing out on powerful strategies that could transform your game.

          I've seen countless people spin their wheels, eating "healthy" but not getting results. The missing piece? Understanding and tracking macros. It's the difference between throwing ingredients in a pot and following a precise recipe.

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Let me break this down in simple terms: your body doesn't see food as "good" or "bad" - it sees molecules and nutrients. When you track macros, you're essentially becoming your own nutrition scientist. You're giving your body exactly what it needs, when it needs it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Think of it like building a house. Calories are your total building materials, but macros are the specific materials you need - the right amount of bricks, wood, and steel. You wouldn't build a house with just one material, would you?
